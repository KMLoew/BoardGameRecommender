This repository contains my analysis of data from boardgamegeeks.com

The data was scrapped with Scrapper.ipynb which was derived from https://sdsawtelle.github.io/blog/output/boardgamegeek-data-scraping.html

This program gathers user ratings of games and stores that as a csv file.

Analysis_SimpleSurprise.ipynb uses sckit-surprise to implement singular value decomposition and thereby predict how users will rate other games.

If you want the csv files of the ratings please do not hesitate to ask, my email is above.
